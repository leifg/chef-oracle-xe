# Description

This recipe installs an Oracle XE server instance.

## Prequisits

As it is not possible to automatically download the binary for the Oracle XE server (Oracle expects you to have an account in order to download the files) you need to add the .rpm file to /mnt/share before you run the recipe.

Alternatively you can specifiy another path (or filename) in the attributes.

## Requirements

You will need at least 2GB of RAM so keep that in mind when you set up your machine.
